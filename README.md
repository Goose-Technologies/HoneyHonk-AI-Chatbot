HoneyHonk-AI-Chatbot
🚀 What is HoneyHonk?

HoneyHonk is an AI chatbot that runs on GPT-NeoX-20B (a massive language model).
It’s smart, sassy, and occasionally confused—just like a real bee trying to figure out quantum physics.

This bot runs directly from your terminal with no extra setup. Just install the requirements, launch it, and start chatting!
🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Check by running:

python --version

If you don’t have it, grab it from: python.org
2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Before launching HoneyHonk, install the required libraries:

pip install transformers torch

This downloads everything HoneyHonk needs to function (except a love for honey—that’s built-in).
3️⃣ Run HoneyHonk 🐝

Now, let’s wake up the bot! Run:

python honeyhonk.py

HoneyHonk will take a few seconds to load (it's a big brain). Once ready, you'll see:

HoneyHonk is ready to chat! Type 'exit' to stop.
You:

Type something like:

You: Hello there!
HoneyHonk: Bzzz! Hey human, what’s up? 🐝

✨ Features

✅ Super Smart – Uses GPT-NeoX-20B to generate responses
✅ Sassy & Fun – Will try its best to sound witty
✅ Terminal-Based – No servers, no web apps, just pure chat
🔧 Troubleshooting
"Command not found" or "ModuleNotFoundError"?

Try running with python3 instead of python:

python3 honeyhonk.py

If modules are missing, reinstall them:

pip install --upgrade transformers torch

The bot is slow or crashes?

    This model is HUGE (like, "I need a gaming PC" huge).
    Use a GPU if possible! It runs terribly on CPU.
    If you’re on a low-end machine, consider using a smaller model like GPT-2 (EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M).

🐝 Exit HoneyHonk

Tired of chatting? Just type:

exit
quit
bye

And HoneyHonk will buzz off.

    Just don’t blame me when it starts demanding honey as payment. 🐝🍯
